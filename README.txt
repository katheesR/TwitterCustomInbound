Welcome to the WSO2 Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) Custom Inbound Endpoints.

A Custom Inbound Endpoint allows you to interact with a third-party product's functionality and data from your ESB message flow, enabling you to connect to and interact with the streaming APIs of services such as Twitter.
This means that if you have added the Twitter custom inbound endpoint in your ESB instance, your message flow could receive requests containing a user's Twitter consumer key,consumer secret,access token and access secret, log into the user's Twitter
account, get the streaming messages and inject to the esb sequence.
